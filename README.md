# Posy's Improved Cursors (Hyprcursor Port)

This is a [Hyprcursor](https://github.com/hyprwm/hyprcursor) port of Michiel de Boer's amazing cursor design.
He presented it in a brilliant video in 2018: [Posy - Mouse Cursor History (and why I made my own)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThelfB2fvg)

> This unfortunately is not a faithful port because the vector graphics for this cursor are not available publicly, I have informed Michiel about this and  suggested putting the source files for the cursor under an Open-Soruce license or atleast putting them in the public.

>> Discussion can be followed [here](https://github.com/simtrami/posy-improved-cursor-linux/issues/13).

The original work can be found on his website, [michieldb.nl](http://www.michieldb.nl/other/cursors/), as well as installers for Windows.

Thank you [@simtrami](https://github.com/simtrami) for the clean port to Linux.

## What's in there

The following sets are ported.
Some of them use cursors form the *Extras* set: the black and mono black ones use the black hand and the inverted move cursor.
